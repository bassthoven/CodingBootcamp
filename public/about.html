<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Adam. I am 32 years old. I am brand new to coding, but am going full speed at learning full stack. I know I can do this. I have always coded in some way, for almost as long as I have had a computer.</p>

<p>I have loved Udemy's courses for their affordability, and amount of options. I have learned so much, and paid a fraction of the cost of what I was paying in school.</p>

<p>This class however is the best I have taken yet. I feel like I am getting right to work, and learning how to do real world stuff right off the bat. I want to get a job coding, and I believe I have taken a right step in that direction.</p>
