<h1>Adam's Favorite Movie Series</h1>
<h2>All Time Top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>James Bond</h3>
<p>Always been a favorite, and I aim to be like James and do everything.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Probably the series I have rewatched the most, though they are long with only three I have watched them over and over.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Growing up at the perfect age to grow up with the characters from Harry Potter, one could not hope but be enamoured with this rich world of magic and mystery, and I was in love as a child, and still am to this day.</p>
